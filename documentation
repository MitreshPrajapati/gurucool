#Backend System Documentation

1. Introduction:

The backend system is designed to efficiently manage requests from multiple users using a queue structure. Each client connected will have its queue where all requests will be processed sequentially. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, implementation details, testing approach, and deployment strategy.

2. System Architecture:

The system follows a client-server model, where users interact with the server through a user interface. Each client connection has a dedicated queue managed by the queue management system. Worker processes pull requests from the queues and execute them sequentially. The system includes components for user authentication, request queueing, request processing, concurrency management, scalability, robustness, and logging.

3. Implementation:

 User Authentication:

- Set up an authentication mechanism using Passport.js.
- Create endpoints for user signup and login.
- Implement user registration logic in the signup endpoint.
- Implement user login logic in the login endpoint.
- Generate JWT tokens upon successful authentication.
- Secure routes by verifying JWT tokens.

 Queue Setup:

- Choose a messaging/queueing system like RabbitMQ, Redis, or Kafka.
- Set up the chosen queueing system.
- Create a queue for each client upon successful authentication.
- Ensure that each client's queue is isolated and accessible only by the authenticated client.

 Worker Processes:

- Design and implement worker processes to handle tasks from the queues.
- Implement logic to pull requests from the queues in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner.
- Execute tasks sequentially, ensuring one task completes before moving to the next.
